# Linear-Regression-Problems

In this project we solve the exercise 9 of the Chapter 3, from the book Linear Regression, de James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R. (2013). An Introduction to Statistical Learning.

In the second exercise we carry out the adjustment of a regression model for the database  June 13 data.csv, ’data.frame’:23137 obs. of 14 variables.

To run the code is necessary to download the dataset, without any change in the name, and change the path of the dataset in the code, line 94, to the path of that file in your computer.
